CONSTRAINT fk_department: This specifies the name of the foreign key constraint. In this case, it's named fk_department.

FOREIGN KEY (department_id): This indicates that the department_id column in the employee table is the foreign key column. A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.

REFERENCES department(department_id): This specifies the referenced table and column for the foreign key constraint. It means that the department_id column in the employee table references the department_id column in the department table. In other words, the values in the department_id column of the employee table must exist in the department_id column of the department table. This ensures referential integrity between the two tables, meaning that each employee must belong to a valid department.

So, overall, this line establishes a constraint that ensures that the department_id column in the employee table can only contain values that exist in the department_id column of the department table.
