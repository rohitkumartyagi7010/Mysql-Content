-- In MySQL triggers, OLD and NEW are used to reference the values before and after an operation (like an UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE) on a table.
-- Hereâ€™s what they mean in the context of your trigger:

-- 1. OLD:
-- OLD refers to the previous values (before the update) of the fields in the table.

-- It is only available in BEFORE UPDATE, AFTER UPDATE, and DELETE triggers, where it allows you to access the data that is currently in the row,
-- before the update or deletion happens.

-- OLD.acc_no: This refers to the account number before the update. Since the account number (acc_no) usually doesn't change, it's likely
--  the same before and after the update.

-- OLD.avail_balance: 
-- This refers to the available balance in the customer table before the update. In the context of your trigger,
-- This value is inserted into the mini_statement table to store the old balance.

-- 2. NEW:
-- NEW refers to the new values (after the update) of the fields in the table.

-- It is available in INSERT and UPDATE triggers. It allows you to access the new data that is being inserted or the updated data after the change.

-- NEW.avail_balance: This refers to the updated balance in the customer table. After the update happens,
-- this new balance is what will be in the customer table. In your trigger, you are capturing this updated balance and inserting it into the mini_statement table.
 

-- check triggers on database if any

-- we created trigger on update command so lets test it
