    "There are additional types of cascading actions in SQL that can be applied with foreign keys, besides ON DELETE CASCADE. These cascading actions help maintain referential integrity between tables when certain operations occur on the parent table. Here are the main types of cascading actions:\n",

    "1. ON DELETE CASCADE\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: Deletes the corresponding rows in the child table when a row in the parent table is deleted.\n",
    "Use Case: If you want to automatically remove all dependent records in the child table when a parent record is deleted.\n",

    "2. ON UPDATE CASCADE\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: Updates the foreign key values in the child table when the referenced primary key in the parent table is updated.\n",
    "Use Case: When you modify a key in the parent table, the corresponding key in the child table should also be updated to match.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. ON DELETE SET NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: Sets the foreign key column(s) in the child table to NULL when the referenced row in the parent table is deleted.\n",
    "Use Case: If you don't want to delete the child records but want to mark that they no longer reference a valid parent row.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ON UPDATE SET NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: Sets the foreign key column(s) in the child table to NULL when the referenced row in the parent table is updated.\n",
    "Use Case: If the parent key changes and the foreign key should no longer point to the updated parent, it can be set to NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ON DELETE SET DEFAULT\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: Sets the foreign key column(s) in the child table to a default value when the referenced row in the parent table is deleted.\n",
    "Use Case: When you want child records to retain a specific default value when the parent is deleted, instead of being deleted or set to NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT\n",
    "Behavior: Sets the foreign key column(s) in the child table to a default value when the referenced row in the parent table is updated.\n",
    "Use Case: Similar to SET NULL, but assigns a specific default value instead of NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. ON DELETE RESTRICT\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: Prevents the deletion of a row in the parent table if there are any corresponding rows in the child table.\n",
    "Use Case: Use this when you want to stop deletion of a parent record as long as it is being referenced by child records.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. ON UPDATE RESTRICT\n",
    "Behavior: Prevents the update of a row in the parent table if it is referenced by any rows in the child table.\n",
